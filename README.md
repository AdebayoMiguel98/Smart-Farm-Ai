# 🌾 Smart Farm AI – Signature Verification System

Smart Farm AI is an **AI-powered signature verification system** built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and **Flask**.  
The project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to **detect forged and genuine signatures**.  
It provides a **web-based interface** to train, test, and deploy the model.
